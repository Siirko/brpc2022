# About The Project
This project consist in a use case of BeepBeep with BeamNG.



# Getting Started

## Note
We highly suggest you to use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with [Python plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/631-python) if you want to work with what have been done.

## Prerequisites
* Windows 10 (BeamNG seems to not work on Linux)

* Last version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* BeamNGPy package, just do `pip install beamngpy` into your shell terminal

* BeamNG.tech license (_you can ask yours [here](https://register.beamng.tech/)_)

## BeamNGPy
##### Work in progress
To use BeamNGPy library, you need to setup your tech.key received with your BeamNG.tech license, we suggest you to check their [github](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy#prereqs).

In order to analyze the vehicles' data, you'll have to know what you're looking for first.
Each vehicle has its own set of sensors, producing values that we will call "properties" from now on. These properties may change during the simulation.

You can find a list of existing properties related to a vehicle's state [here](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/0f25ee8d047e787240fa624ddfa3f9d54addf0ca/src/beamngpy/vehicle.py#L116-L133), and most importantly the "electrics" properties [here](https://github.com/BeamNG/BeamNGpy/blob/3009c6f80045f05ca78a376d7c4d0bcf416e9316/src/beamngpy/sensors.py#L978-L1050).

## IDE Configuration
### IntelliJ
You have to simply clone the repo, open the folder in Intelj and wait gradle build to finish and you are done, or almost.

#### Python module
Intelj have a wonderful Python plugin that make possible a better workflow (instead of using PyCharm, you now use only one IDE). To setup this follow the instruction below :

1. Open Project Structure : File > Project structure ...
2. Go to Project settings > Modules section
3. Select "+" sign and choose "Import module"
4. Select src/python folder
5. Select "Create module from existing sources"
6. Be sure to have checked the checkbox with the absolute path with the python folder that you selected
7. Select "+" sign and Add new Python SDK
8. Choose a location, we suggest you to choose `...\src\main\python\venv`, check _Inherit global site-packages_
9. Django framework are detected, uncheck if you don't want to use it in the project (we don't use it so we suggest you to uncheck it), and click __Create__  
   Now the python folder is considered has a Python module, but you have to select the SDK that you created just before for the python module, apply and everything is good to go. We suggest you to restart your IDE and now normaly everything is setup.

# Usage
##### Work in progress
Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.


## BeepBeep 3's starter pack

Assuming you're done with setting up the project and with sending the sockets from the client, you will now learn how to read and interpret a vehicle's properties by using BeepBeep.
First of all, you may want to check out BeepBeep's official resources, including:
its [website](http://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3/)
, [official documentation](https://liflab.gitbook.io/event-stream-processing-with-beepbeep-3/)
and its [API javadoc](https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3/javadoc/index.html).


### Reading incoming sockets
To read incoming sockets, you will have to create a new Source object (since it has no input stream), which we called "SocketReader", with an output arity of 1.
Then, you'll have to override its compute() method, and add the JSON you've just read, as a string, to the outputs Queue object.
If no data is available, this means that the simulation has ended and that the server should be closed.

Now, you have a processor which **COULD** read the sockets, get the JSON-string and transfer it to the next processor in the chain, **if another processor asks it to**.
The problem is that no one does.

### Getting a JsonMap to read the wanted properties from
What you'll have to do now, is to set up a [Pump](https://liflab.gitbook.io/event-stream-processing-with-beepbeep-3/advanced#pumps-and-tanks) processor, which will request the current JSON-string to the SocketReader you just set up, with a constant delay which should preferably be the same as the one with which you're sending the sockets. When the pump gets the requested string, it will push it until the end of the processors' chain.

The pump being in place, you will be able to retrieve a string. But, what you want is to get a specific property.
To do that, you will want to parse the String as a JsonMap (we used the JSON library that the LIF made, so the JsonMap is basically a HashMap), using an ApplyFunction (which is a descendant of the Processor class).

An ApplyFunction needs to be given a function (which will return an output based on an input). Since the function only needs one input, it will extend the UnaryFunction class.
In our case, the function takes a String as input and returns a JsonElement (which is a superclass of JsonMap, and which could also represent a property).
We now have our JsonMap object.

### Getting a property from our JsonMap
Imagine you want to get many properties, and process them differently.
For example, let's say you want to get the "wheelspeed" property, which is a number, and the "lowfuel" property, which is a boolean (both of them are in the "electrics" sensors).

Since the JSON-string of a vehicle stores all the vehicle's properties, you don't want to parse the string as a map many times. So you will just use the map as an input to 2 different chains of processors.
To do that, you'll have to use a Fork processor, with an output arity of 2 (this will depend on the number of properties you want to analyze).
Now, you have two outputs with the same JsonMap that you can treat differently.

#### Group Processors
First, have a look at [the doc](https://liflab.gitbook.io/event-stream-processing-with-beepbeep-3/core#grouping-processors).
We coded three main groups of processors, the first one being GetBooleanFromJsonMap, the second one being GetNumberFromJsonMap and the last one being GetStringFromJsonMap (this one isn't used at the moment since the sensors only return numbers/booleans).
These will allow you to get a property, depending on its type (whether it's a boolean/number/string), directly from the JsonElement representing the map.
How they work is: you give them the path of the property (in the json map), it parses the element (the same way we did to parse the string to a map, except we changed the parameter function given to our ApplyFunction) to what you want and returns its value.

You can now connect each of your fork's outputs to the input of one of this group of processors, and get the value of the property as its output.
Here, it would be something like

```java 
GroupProcessor getRpm = new GetNumberFromJsonMap("electrics.rpm");
GroupProcessor getLowFuel = new GetBooleanFromJsonMap("electrics.lowfuel");
Connector.connect(fork, 0, getRpm, 0);
Connector.connect(fork, 1, getLowFuel, 0);
```

We coded many other groups of processors, for example GetMinimum() and GetMaximum() which both return a number.

Now, feel free to create your own chains of processors to store or process your properties.
